## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Review Hate Speech Lexicons
- Familiarize yourself with definitions and categories of hate speech used in this project.  
- Reference: [PeaceTech Lab Nigeria Lexicon](https://www.peacetechlab.org/nigeria-lexicon) and related resources.

### 2. Collect Data from X.com
- Use **search operators** and advanced search filters to identify relevant posts.  
- Example: [X.com Advanced Search Guide](https://help.x.com/en/using-x/x-advanced-search).  
- Focus on terms or content related to Nigeria’s 2023 general elections and targeted at the Igbo community.

### 3. Categorize Hate Speech
- Each entry should be assigned to one or more categories:  
  - Incitement  
  - Discrimination  
  - Dehumanization  
  - Ethnic Profiling  
  - Disinformation/Misinformation  

### 4. Archive Tweets with Source & Context
- Record the **exact text**, **username**, **date**, and **context** (if known).  
- Save screenshots and/or links.  
- Add supporting notes if the tweet has been deleted.

### 5. Conduct Expert Interviews
- Where possible, gather qualitative insights from journalists, digital rights defenders, or civic actors.  
- Summarize key takeaways that strengthen dataset context.

### 6. Compile Structured Dataset
- Add data to the Excel file (`hate_speech_dataset.xlsx`).  
- Columns include: *Handle, Text from the tweet, Hate Speech Type, Date, Notes*.  
- Keep formatting consistent.

### 7. Refine Search Terms/Keywords
- Document keywords that worked best in uncovering content.  
- Add to the shared list for future contributors.

### 8. Upload Dataset to GitHub
- Commit your updates with clear messages (e.g., `Added 5 new tweets from March 2023`).  
- Push changes to your branch or fork.

### 9. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
- Open a PR describing your contribution.  
- Project maintainers will review for accuracy, ethical concerns, and formatting before merging.
